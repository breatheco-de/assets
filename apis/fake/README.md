# FAKE APIs
A collection of API ideal for fetch.js exercises.

There are 3 very complete apis to play with: [Contact List](./apis/fake/contact/README.md), [Meetup.com](./apis/fake/meetup/README.md) or [Tic Tac Toe](./apis/fake/tictactoe/README.md).  
But you also have these small apis for very particular purposes:
